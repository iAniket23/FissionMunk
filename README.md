**FissionMunk** is a lightweight 2D physics open source python library designed to simulate nuclear fission reactor mechanics. It enables users to visualize interactions between neutrons and uranium atoms, providing valuable insights into fission dynamics with customizable parameters, such as neutron occurrence probabilities, moderators, and control rods. FissionMunk is ideal for educational simulations, nuclear physics research, and interactive demos, and is built on top of the [Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/) library.

## Getting Started with FissionMunk
FissionMunk makes it easy to simulate and visualize nuclear fission dynamics. To get started, follow these steps:

### Installation

To install FissionMunk, use `pip`:
```bash
pip install fissionmunk
```
### Set Up Your First Simulation
Now that youâ€™ve installed FissionMunk, let's create a basic simulation. Here's an example to help you get started:

#### Example: Basic Fission Simulation
```python
import pygame

from fissionmunk import Core
from fissionmunk import Moderator
from fissionmunk import ControlRod
from fissionmunk import Fuel
from fissionmunk import Water
from fissionmunk import Material
from fissionmunk import Mechanics
```
```python
# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()
display = pygame.display.set_mode((700, 600))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS = 60
```

### Documentation Overview
The following modules are included in FissionMunk and offer various simulation controls:

- **Core**: Manages the main simulation environment and fuel elements.
- **ControlRod**: Controls neutron absorption, allowing for fission rate adjustments.
- **Moderator**: Slows down neutrons to maintain optimal reaction rates.
- **FuelElement**: Represents fuel elements, such as uranium atoms, in the simulation.
- **Neutron**: Models individual neutrons and their interactions.

Refer to the full documentation for module-specific details and usage examples.
